# Database Directory

This is where databases will be created and written to. The intention is for the scripts to do this automatically. The git ignore files are set to not move these files in or out of version control because of the large size. The intention is for these to be created locally with the code in the script directory.

## Settings
In the main config.py the name of this directory is 

### Database Folder 
The database folder is declared in the `DATABASE_DIR` setting in the config.py file

### SQL Database
The SQL Database is named in the `SQL_DATABASE` setting in the config.py file
